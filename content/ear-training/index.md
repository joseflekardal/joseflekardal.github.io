This is a web app for training your musical ear.

At the core, you will hear a major scale and then a secret note. Click the button of the secret note and earn one point.

Under settings you can tailor the experience to your needs, secret chords instead of secret notes can be used for instance.

_Hope you will like it / Josef_
