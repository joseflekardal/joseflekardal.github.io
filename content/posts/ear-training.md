### Hi :wave:

I finally decided to start a blog, somewhere I can put out my own stuff and thoughts. Maybe someone will read it, _probably not_, that is completely fine - I do this 100% for myself.

The first little project that I am currently working on is a web app for ear training. This one is inspired by a youtube video that I saw the other day.

I've been thinking about making something similar for a long time and this video got me inspired to finally do so. I like the way he presents the concept in the video. To replicate something similar with code would be easy and could be iterated on. Also I think it could be very useful. So I started hacking together a proof of concept. It currentlt only has the key of C and the bare minimum ui but it is working.

I think that the next step is to continue building out the functionality. I want it to change key after each run, it should be possible to have multiple secret notes to be played back and that should be configurable. Maybe play back the secret notes as a cluster/chord... It should be possible to customize the speed and ofcourse it needs a fun UI, probably a SVG piano, hand drawn...? :thinking:

The current version of the ear training app is [here]({{< ref "/ear-training" >}} "Ear training").

Come back later and have a look as build the ear training, the actual blog and more. Peace!
