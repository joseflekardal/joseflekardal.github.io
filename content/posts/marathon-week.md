### Why am I doing this? ðŸ˜¬

This is marathon week, I've trained somewhat well but I am so nervous! The weather will be super hot and I don't now if I am ready for it.

I recently ran 32k in 24Âº and that felt good, I was able to run the last hour really fast, way over my predicted marathon pace. But saturday will probably be even hotter, currently 28Âº... A good thing is that I was able to use gels well on that run, had no problems eating one every 30 minutes and was also drinking some sports drink.

This morning I woke up feeling absolutely ran over, dont know why, yesterday I ran 5k and it felt very easy.. It feels much better now but I'm really hoping that it was temporary! My recent runs have felt great, I did a 10k run earlier this week in the sun, wearing a longsleeve and was able to run with controlled heart rate slightly faster than marathon pace. The recent runs have all been performed with lower heart rate and slightly faster pace which feels great, but will it be enough? Considering the heat I will start att 10 seconds slower than my original planned 5:20 pace. Will definitely drink on every station and I will still be eating my one gel every 30 minutes.

Tomorrow I need to pick up my kit at the marathon expo down town, I also need to find a white t-shirt that will hopefully work better than my dark ones in the sun. I am stoked but a bit scared... Let's go!
