### I signed up for Adidas Stockholm Marathon :running:
I've been running for a few years, last year was my first race - Midnattsloppet, I also did much more running last year than what I've done in the past. For this year I set up a new years resolution to participate in the Stockholm Marathon.

Since december I have not been able to get any training done except for a few days around christmas, I haven't been healthy enough. But since march I've been running frequently, on average 40 km every week. At the moment I'm trying to increase my long runs weekly volume but I'm a bit scared to overtrain, my goal is to average around 50-60 km every week.

My longest run so far is [25 km](https://www.strava.com/activities/11083746880) (with my son in the stroller), I've done 21 a lot of times but 25 was really hard to be honest. I probably need to take some kind of energy when going for such a long time, I will try to incorporate some sports drink or gel on the coming long runs.

That's all for now.
